## Description
`x0` is a hardware spoofing and virtualbox hardening solution that consists of 3 main components:
- UEFI Bootkit (UEFI Runtime Driver)
- Kernel Driver
- Userspace Command-line Companion Program

Only 2 of these components are crucial for `x0` to work properly, the kernel driver is optional as it just provides extra features for the userspace program.
The main purpose of userspace program is to:
- Overwrite the native bootloader of the OS (usually GRUB) with the code of the bootkit loader
- Bootkit gets copied to the ESP (EFI System Partition)
- Invoke a reboot
- Bootkit loader gets executed

On execution, the bootkit loader does 3 main things:
- Validate the UEFI driver (Check for invalid signatures, etc)
- Map the UEFI driver into memory and execute it
- Chainload BOOTX64

When the bootkit gets loaded, it performs of series of tasks depending on how it's configured:
- Hooking `GetVariable` via swapping pointers in the system table, and then updating the CRC32 checksum
- Creating an event for `SetVirtualAddressMap` which calls `gRT->ConvertPointer(...)` to convert the pointer of the original `GetVariable`
- Scans through memory to find the SMBIOS tables    (Depending on configuration)
- If the table gets found, then it will be modified (Depending on configuration)

At the end of all of this, `BOOTX64` will be chainloaded so that we can boot into the OS despite GRUB being overwritten earlier.


### Features
- Modification of SMBIOS tables
- Modification of UEFI variables containing data that could be used to detect a VirtualBox instance
